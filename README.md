## Install Server

Bash: \
`npm install web-dev-server`

Create file run.js.\
in run.js:

```javascript
var WebDevServer = require("web-dev-server");

// Create web server instance.
WebDevServer.Server.CreateNew()
   // Required.
   .SetDocumentRoot(__dirname)
   // Optional, 8000 by default.
   .SetPort(8000)
   // Optional, '127.0.0.1' by default.
   //.SetHostname('127.0.0.1')
   // Optional, `true` by default to display Errors and directories.
   //.SetDevelopment(false)
   // Optional, `null` by default, useful for Apache `mod_proxy` usage.
   //.SetBasePath('/node')
   // Optional, custom place to log any unhandled errors.
   //.SetErrorHandler(async function (err,code,req,res) {})
   // Optional, to prepend any execution before `web-dev-server` module execution.
   .AddPreHandler(async function (req, res, event) {
      if (req.GetPath() == '/health') {
       res.SetCode(200).SetBody('1').Send();
        // Do not anything else in `web-dev-server` module for this request:
         event.PreventDefault();
      }
      /*setTimeout(() => {
         throw new RangeError("Uncatched test error.");
      }, 1000);*/
   })
   // optional, callback called after server has been started or after error ocured
   .Start(function (success, err) {
      if (!success) console.error(err);
      console.log("Server is running.");
   });
```

Run server:\
`node run.js`

Create empty folder ./app, next to ./run.js with new empty file ./app/index.js
inside, executed as default directory content later.
Initialize web application instance in ./app/index.js:
```javascript
var WebDevServer = require("web-dev-server");

/**
 * @summary 
 * Exported class to handle directory requests.
 * 
 * When there is first request to directory with default 
 * `index.js` script inside, this class is automatically 
 * created and method `Start()` is executed.
 * All request are normally handled by method `HttpHandle()`.
 * If there is detected any file change inside this file 
 * or inside file included in this file (on development server 
 * instance), the module `web-dev-server` automaticly reloads 
 * all necesssary dependent source codes, stops previous instance 
 * by method `Stop`() and recreates this application instance again
 * by `Start()` method. The same realoding procedure is executed, 
 * if there is any unhandled error inside method `HttpHandle()` 
 * (to develop more comfortably).
 */
class App {

   constructor () {
      /**
       * @summary WebDevServer server instance.
       * @var {WebDevServer.Server}
       */
      this.server = null;
      /**
       * @summary Requests counter. 
       * @var {number}
       */
      this.counter = 0;
   }

   /** 
    * @summary Application start point.
    * @public
    * @param {WebDevServer.Server}   server
    * @param {WebDevServer.Request}  firstRequest
    * @param {WebDevServer.Response} firstResponse
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
   async Start (server, firstRequest, firstResponse) {
      this.server = server;
      // Any initializations:
      console.log("App start.");
   }

   /** 
    * @summary Application end point, called on unhandled error 
    * (on development server instance) or on server stop event.
    * @public
    * @param {WebDevServer.Server} server
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
   async Stop (server) {
      // Any destructions:
      console.log("App stop.");
   }
   
   /**
    * @summary 
    * This method is executed each request to directory with 
    * `index.js` script inside or into any non-existing directory,
    * inside directory with this script.
    * @public
    * @param {WebDevServer.Request}  request
    * @param {WebDevServer.Response} response
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
   async HttpHandle (request, response) {
      console.log("App http handle.");

      // increase request counter:
      this.counter++;
      
      // try to uncomment line bellow to see rendered error in browser:
      //throw new Error("Uncatched test error 1.");

      response
         .SetHeader('content-Type', 'text/javascript')
         .SetBody(
            JSON.stringify({
               basePath: request.GetBasePath(),

         )

# About
Hextris was originally created by a couple high school friends (who are now in college!) who unfortunately don't have as much time to update the game. If you'd like to support the open-source development of Hextris, please consider donating at:

**ETH:** `0xbf5414129552D37B4Fb12D058Cf1596B960d25b2`

The code was forked and updated to a Progressive Web App by [Chris Love](https://twitter.com/chrislove/). The purpose to show how easy it is to make a progressive web app and of course to have some fun!
